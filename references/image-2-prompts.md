# Image-2 Prompt Rules

Write prompts for image-2. Each prompt must generate exactly one 16:9 PPT-style slide image.

## Deck-wide style lock

Define one shared style lock before per-page prompts. It must specify:

- aspect ratio: 16:9;
- deck type: professional consulting-style PPT page;
- layout system: title area, content grid, margins, chart/table/card treatment;
- palette: primary, secondary, background, accent colors;
- typography: clear hierarchy, readable slide text, no decorative fonts;
- visual language: charts, diagrams, icons, photography, or abstract business visuals;
- density: high, medium, or low;
- optional LOGO space: no reserved area, upper-left reserved area, or upper-right reserved area;
- consistency rule: every page must look like part of the same deck.

Repeat the complete style lock inside every page prompt, but mark it as non-visible generation guidance. The style lock must influence layout and visual treatment only; image-2 must not render the style-lock wording as text on the slide.

## Per-page prompt structure

Each page prompt must include:

1. `Model`: image-2.
2. `Task`: generate only this single 16:9 PPT slide image.
3. `Style lock`: copy the shared deck-wide style lock.
4. `Style text handling`: state that style descriptions are instructions only and must not appear as visible text.
5. `Slide logic`: key question, governing thought, supporting logic, so what, transition.
6. `Expanded content`: the richer explanation or examples that should guide the visual emphasis.
7. `LOGO space`: if requested, reserve a small clear area in the chosen top corner; do not invent or render a logo unless the user provided one.
8. `Page message and content`: explain the thought this page should express, the core content to show, and the recommended title, key messages, labels, and emphasis.
9. `Composition`: layout, visual hierarchy, chart or diagram structure, spacing, alignment.
10. `Readability`: clean typography, enough contrast, no tiny unreadable text.
11. `Constraints`: factual constraints and source-material limits.
12. `Negative constraints`: forbidden outputs.

## Page message and content

Do not constrain the slide by enumerating every allowed visible word. Instead, describe the page's intended communication clearly enough for image-2 to design the slide:

- State the page's governing thought in an answer-first way.
- Explain the core content the slide should communicate, including the most important evidence, comparison, process, framework, or recommendation.
- Suggest the title, short labels, callouts, and chart/table labels that would help express the idea, but keep text concise and slide-like.
- Preserve McKinsey-style communication: structured, logical, executive-readable, and focused on one message per page.
- Do not render prompt section labels or internal reasoning labels such as "Style lock", "Slide logic", "Expanded content", "Page message and content", "McKinsey-style", "16:9", "professional consulting-style", or "image-2".
- If a style concept needs to show visually, express it through layout, color, spacing, chart treatment, and imagery, not through written words.
- If a LOGO area is reserved, it is a blank layout area unless the user supplies a logo. Do not render placeholder text such as "LOGO".
- Slide sequence numbers are file-management metadata only. Do not render page numbers, slide numbers, sequence labels, numeric badges, or file names anywhere in the image unless a number is explicitly part of the approved page content.
- For illustration-led styles, express the approved visual direction through recurring characters, coherent scenes, consistent linework or rendering, and visual metaphors; do not write the style name or illustration instructions on the slide.

Add this sentence to every prompt:

```text
Render concise slide text that supports the page message; all style descriptions, prompt section labels, and generation instructions are non-visible guidance and must not appear as words in the slide image.
```

## Negative constraints

Always forbid:

- multiple slides in one image;
- montage, contact sheet, overview, collage, or thumbnail grid;
- browser screenshot, app screenshot, chat screenshot, or document screenshot;
- long paragraphs, dense report prose, or text that does not support the page's governing thought;
- any visible wording copied from style descriptions, prompt section labels, or generation instructions;
- page numbers, slide numbers, sequence labels, numeric badges, or file names added only to identify the image;
- meta words such as style lock, deck-wide style, 16:9, image-2, prompt, McKinsey-style, typography, palette, layout system, consulting-style, Page message and content, or LOGO;
- watermark, signature, logo, model mark, or random brand mark;
- random icons, people, company names, or data not provided or approved;
- SVG, HTML, wireframe, or code-like rendering.

## Batch output

Generate one image per approved prompt. Use ordered names when saving files:

```text
images/slide-01.png
images/slide-02.png
images/slide-03.png
```

If a page fails visually, revise or regenerate that page only unless the style lock itself changed.
